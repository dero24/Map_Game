# Rendering — style, shaders, ground paint, grass

Read this when the task touches the look: materials, shaders, palettes, ground paint, grass,
or per-region style.

## Style + recipe

- `src/world/styles.ts` — `regionStyle(lat,lon)`, `meta.style`, `setActiveStyle` on main +
  tile worker.
- `src/world/recipe.ts` — `recipeFor(bd, style)`: every per-building look decision, a pure
  f(bd.s, style, fc/rc).
- Facade shader codes: siding in the fraction of `vInfo.y` (kind + code/10), roof material in
  `vInfo.w` on roof faces, region window vocabulary in `uWinStyle`.

## Shader + material conventions

- All materials are custom ShaderMaterials sharing uniforms in `src/render/shared.ts`; the
  look lives in `src/render/post.ts`.
- Varyings that carry ids/seeds (`vInfo`, `vTan`, `vOut`) must be `flat` — interpolated ids
  (up to ~8.5 M) drift per pixel and every `seedOf(id)` choice shimmers (the old window
  flicker).
- Local frame: +x east, +z south (north = −z), metres, per-region origin from config.

## Ground paint

- `groundPaint.ts` windows `detail` (300 m) + `mid` (1.6 km) re-centre on the walker and paint
  baked + streamed-tile features (stream `onTile`/`onUnload` → `paint.setTile/dropTile`); the
  shader applies them everywhere.

## Grass

- `src/world/grass.ts` — player-centred tuft cells, masked by `GroundPaint.grassMask` (grows
  only where the painted ground is open/green). Walks start at today's sunrise (`?hour=`).

## The brush's sketch pass

- `WatercolorPost.render(…, overlay)` draws the brush's scene (ui/brush.ts) into its own target
  (`ghostRT`: colour + depth, made the first time) after the scene, and the composite lays it over
  the painting before the ink: rgb display colour, alpha = coverage (+ 2 where the wash is wet, for
  the bleed past the line). Its outline is the Laplacian of 1/z on its own depth, drawn twice with a
  7 fps jitter (the boil) and broken by the paper's tooth; where the scene's depth is nearer it's
  dashed and the fill fainter. `U.uBrush` pales the world round it; `U.uRipple` rings the water as a
  painted boat settles; `U.uGhost` = (on, line, bleed, harness mask).

## Sketch → paint (post composite)

- `post.ts` composite reconstructs world position from depth (`uInvProj`, `uCamWorld`,
  `uWorldOff`) and samples `U.uExplore`. Unexplored pixels become view-anchored graphite hatching
  on paper (three stroke families by tone, lighter with distance), and ink lines get stronger.
  Explored pixels keep the wash, with pigment pooling at the bloom rim. The sky is never sketched.
